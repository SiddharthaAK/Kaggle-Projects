This repository contains my experiments and learning projects based on Kaggle competitions. Each folder corresponds to a specific project.  

## Projects  

### [1. Binary Classification on Bank Marketing Dataset](./1)  
Kaggle Competition: [Playground Series - Season 5, Episode 8](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/playground-series-s5e8/data)  

Implemented an end-to-end supervised learning pipeline to strengthen foundations in **binary classification** and **model evaluation**. Key steps include:  
- Data preprocessing & categorical encoding  
- Stratified K-Fold cross-validation  
- Model development with **LightGBM**  
- Hyperparameter optimization using **Optuna**  
- Performance tracking with ROC-AUC  
- Probability-based submission file generation
